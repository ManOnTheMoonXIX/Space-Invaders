# Space Invaders: A Retro Gaming Experience
A work-in-progress (WIP) project that aims to create the classic Space Invaders video game using HTML canvas and JavaScript! This game is designed to be highly customizable, allowing you to tweak nearly every aspect to suit your preferences. To jump into the action, simply fork the repository and run the index.html file.

## Player Movement
Experience smooth and intuitive controls as you navigate your ship through the alien onslaught:

W - Move Up

A - Move Left

S - Move Down

D - Move Right

Spacebar - Shoot

## Power-Ups
Keep an eye out for power-ups that occasionally spawn during gameplay! These special items float around in random directions and can provide temporary boosts when collected or shot.

### Fire Rate Buff

This power-up increases your shot fire rate for a default time of five seconds


### Broad Shot Buff

With this power-up, you can shoot three projectiles at once instead of just one for five seconds!


## Future Update Ideas
My ideas for future updates include:

- Scoreboard: Track your high scores and compete with friends!

- Player Lives Mechanic: Instead of an instant game over upon being hit by an enemy projectile, players will have multiple lives to keep the action going.

- Additional Power-Ups: Introduce at least three new power-ups to diversify gameplay and strategies.

- Ramping Difficulty: As your score increases, the game will become progressively more challenging, keeping you on your toes!
